## 🧠 Future Improvements

This is just version 1. A few things on the wishlist:

- Cloud sync / login support
- Reminders before class starts
- Dark mode toggle (for those who need it 😅)

## 🙌 Made for Students, by a Student

I built this app while navigating college life myself. If it helps even one person stay on top of their attendance (or at least avoid the short attendance list), it's worth it.

Feel free to suggest improvements or report bugs – I'm always learning.
